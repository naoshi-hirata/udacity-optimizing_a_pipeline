# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
This dataset contains data about customers and whether or not they have subscribed to a term deposit. We seek to predict whether or not they will subscribe to a term deposit.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best performing model was a VotingEnsemble.
 
## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
The pipeline include cleaning and split data, machine learning using LogisticRegression argorizm from siktlearn, tuning hyperparameters are C(0.1, 1, 10),and max_iter(50, 100, 150).

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
The smaller C is, the more misclassification the model tolerates, and the larger it is, the more severe the model imposes stricter restrictions to reduce misclassification. If the max_iter is small, the model may not fit the training data. On the other hand, if the max_iter is too large, the training time will be longer and the risk of overfitting will increase. 

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**
BanditPolicy allows for more efficient use of resources during training, as it terminates poorly performing runs early, allowing better performing runs to continue for longer.

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**
The algorizm which perform best is VotingEnsemble. I didn't check hyperparameters.

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**
The accuracy of VotingEnsemble in autoML is higher than LogisticRegression a little. VotingEnsemble use several algorizms and predict by voting. The doffernce caused by algorizm, hyperparameters, and training data.

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
Equalizing the number of data points for each class across features. A model is considered incorrect if it has high correlation with the data but no relationship with the target variable (y-value).
